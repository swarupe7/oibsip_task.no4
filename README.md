#Welcome to our Spam Mail Detection project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a logistic regression model to classify whether an email is #spam or not. Spam mail detection is a common problem in the field of data science and machine learning, and logistic regression serves as a simple yet effective
#algorithm for binary classification tasks.

#In this project, we will preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and, if desired, deploy the model for real-time #predictions.
